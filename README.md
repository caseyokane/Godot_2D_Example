# Godot_2D_Examples

Just a repo to contain some of the example projects that I either find interesting or just feel like keeping in source control

## Included Projects 

1. dodge: A project created following [Godot's 2D tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html). Includes some good examples of handling collision between objects and signal usage.
